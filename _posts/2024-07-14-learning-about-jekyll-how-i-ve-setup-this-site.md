Followed along TechnoTim's post and youtube video for the most part of my configuration.
I chose to deploy my site using github pages, but plan to self host another site in the future on my personal homelab. 

I also included Jekyll Compose in my configuration to make post creation a little easier for myself.
## Configuration
 
All the initial value changes made to ```/path/to/_config.yml```
```yml
# Change to your timezone â€º https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker
timezone: America/Los_Angeles

title: TopherMayor # the main title

tagline: A Site logging everything I learn # it will display as the sub-title

description: >- # used by seo meta and the atom feed
  A minimal, responsive and feature-rich Jekyll theme for technical writing.

# Fill in the protocol & hostname for your site.
# e.g. 'https://username.github.io', note that it does not end with a '/'.
url: "https://tophermayor.github.io"

github:
  username: TopherMayor # change to your github username

twitter:
  username: TopherMayor # change to your twitter username

social:

```

## Deployment
Options:
* GitHub Pages 

## Jekyll::Compose

Jekyll::Compose allows you to stream line the process of creating your site by allowing you to add commands.

You can check out the full list of commands and the project [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose)

To make use of the commands all youll need to edit the Gemfile within your jekyll project folder.
Should be something like  ```/path/to/USERNAME.github.io/Gemfile```
Add the following line to that file:

```
gem 'jekyll-compose', group: [:jekyll_plugins]
```

NOTE: aliases will only work while in the correct project folder
Aliases added to can be added to:
Bash: ```~/.bash_aliases``` or ```~/.bashrc```
ZSH: ```~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/aliases.zsh``` or ```~/.zshrc```
NOTE: when using oh-my-zsh custom folder, files must end with the ```.zsh``` extension

```shell
alias jpage='bundle exec jekyll page'
alias jpost='bundle exec jekyll post'
alias jdraft='bundle exec jekyll draft'
alias jrename='bundle exec jekyll rename'
alias junpub='bundle exec jekyll unpublish'
```
